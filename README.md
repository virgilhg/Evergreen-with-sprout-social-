# Evergreen Careers Page  

This project is a polished home + careers page concept for a fictional company called **Evergreen**. It showcases open roles, culture, and benefits with a modern design that emphasizes accessibility and user-friendliness.

## How It’s Made  

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, JS  

I built this project as a front-end showcase focused on **pixel-perfect polish** and **responsive design**. The layout is built with semantic HTML5 and styled using TailwindCSS for speed and consistency. Features include:  

- A sticky header and clean navigation bar.  
- Hero section with background image overlay.  
- Job listings grid with hover effects and location/department tags.  
- Culture & Benefits section with icons and descriptive text.  
- Responsive footer consistent with the overall branding.  

The color palette and typography are tuned for **readability and accessibility**, following WCAG contrast guidelines. I also made sure the design matches Evergreen’s “ever-green” branding with consistent use of custom color variables.

## Optimizations  

While building, I focused on:  

- **Accessibility**: used semantic tags, focus states, and high-contrast text for compliance with accessibility standards.  
- **Performance**: optimized images with lazy-loading patterns and used Tailwind utility classes instead of heavy custom CSS.  
- **Scalability**: structured the code so components (cards, nav, footer) can be easily reused or extended.  

If I had more time, I’d add:  

-  Fully built pages for all links on the page as needed
- A CMS or API to load jobs dynamically instead of hard-coding.  
- Filtering animations for department/location search.  
- Lighthouse audits to squeeze even more performance.

## Lessons Learned  

- Building something “simple” like a home + careers page still teaches a lot about **UX details** — spacing, typography, hover states — things that make a site feel professional.  
- Small touches like gradients, hover transitions, and consistent branding elevate the entire experience.  
- I realized the importance of designing for **non-technical users** — hiring managers, candidates — who just want clarity and speed, not complexity.

👉 This project is about more than just code — it’s about **communicating a brand through design and interaction**, something I know matters for clients.
